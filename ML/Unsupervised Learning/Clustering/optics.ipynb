    "## 1) Concept Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OPTICS** = *Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure*\n",
    "- It is a **density-based** clustering algorithm, like DBSCAN and HDBSCAN,\n",
    "  but instead of choosing a single \\( \\varepsilon \\), it explores **all density levels** in one run.\n",
    "- It produces:\n",
    "  - An **ordering** of points (how reachable they are from dense regions).\n",
    "  - A **reachability plot** — valleys represent clusters, peaks represent gaps or noise.\n",
    "- You can later “cut” this structure to extract clusters, either:\n",
    "  - by setting a fixed threshold (DBSCAN-like), or\n",
    "  - automatically via the **xi method** (detecting sharp drops in reachability).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2) Key Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Core distance** of a point \\( p \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\text{core\\_dist}(p) = \\text{distance from } p \\text{ to its } k\\text{-th nearest neighbor}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  This measures **how dense** the area around \\( p \\) is — smaller value = denser region.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reachability distance** of a point \\( o \\) from a point \\( p \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\text{reach\\_dist}(o|p) = \\max\\big(\\text{core\\_dist}(p),\\, \\text{dist}(p,o)\\big)\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  This captures how difficult it is to reach \\( o \\) from a dense region around \\( p \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3) How the Algorithm Works (Intuition)\n",
    "\n",
    "1️⃣ **Start** with all points unvisited.\n",
    "2️⃣ Pick a random point \\( p \\), compute its core distance, and explore its neighbors.\n",
    "3️⃣ Assign each neighbor a tentative **reachability distance** based on \\( p \\).\n",
    "4️⃣ Always visit the **most reachable** unvisited point next (like Dijkstra’s algorithm).\n",
    "5️⃣ Continue until all points are ordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Result:\n",
    "- Every point has one **final reachability distance** (when popped from the queue).\n",
    "- The **ordering** encodes the structure of density connectivity across all \\( \\varepsilon \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4) Interpreting the Reachability Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Low reachability values** → dense clusters (valleys).\n",
    "- **High reachability values** → sparse regions or cluster boundaries (peaks).\n",
    "- **Long valleys** → large clusters; **short valleys** → smaller clusters.\n",
    "- Clusters can be extracted:\n",
    "  - By choosing a reachability threshold \\( \\varepsilon_{\\text{cut}} \\).\n",
    "  - Or automatically using **xi** (percentage drop detection).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5) Why OPTICS is Useful\n",
    "\n",
    "- It effectively performs **DBSCAN at every possible ε**, all in one run.\n",
    "- You can later “cut” the ordering at any threshold — no need to re-run multiple DBSCANs.\n",
    "- The **reachability plot** provides deep insight into structure and varying densities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6) Relationship to DBSCAN and HDBSCAN\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you “cut” the reachability plot at one threshold → **equivalent to DBSCAN** at that ε.\n",
    "- HDBSCAN also considers all ε, but:\n",
    "  - builds a **hierarchical tree** using mutual reachability distances,\n",
    "  - and chooses clusters that are **stable across ε levels**.\n",
    "- OPTICS, instead of stability analysis, builds a **linear ordering** of points and uses valleys as clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7) Queue Behavior (Dijkstra Analogy)\n",
    "\n",
    "- OPTICS uses a priority queue of unvisited points sorted by reachability distance.\n",
    "- A point’s reachability can be updated many times (if discovered by multiple dense neighbors).\n",
    "- But it’s **added to the ordering only once** — when it’s finally the most reachable (popped from the queue).\n",
    "- This guarantees each point appears **exactly once** in the final cluster order.\n",

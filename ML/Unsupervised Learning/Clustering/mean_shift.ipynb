    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Shift is a **mode-seeking** clustering algorithm â€”\n",
    "it locates the **peaks (modes)** of the dataâ€™s underlying density distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine your data points as hills on a landscape.\n",
    "You drop a small window (kernel) somewhere and look around it.\n",
    "If more data points lie north-east of you, you move a little north-east.\n",
    "You keep shifting the window toward denser regions â€”\n",
    "until it stops moving at a density peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "All points that converge to the same peak belong to the same cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "For each data point \\(x_i\\):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize**\n",
    "   Start with \\(y_0 = x_i\\) â€” the window center.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Update**\n",
    "   Move the window to the **weighted mean** of its neighbors:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   y_{t+1} =\n",
    "   \\frac{\\sum_j K\\!\\left(\\frac{\\|x_j - y_t\\|^2}{h^2}\\right) x_j}\n",
    "        {\\sum_j K\\!\\left(\\frac{\\|x_j - y_t\\|^2}{h^2}\\right)}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   where:\n",
    "   - \\(x_j\\) â†’ j-th data point\n",
    "   - \\(y_t\\) â†’ current window center (vector)\n",
    "   - \\(h\\) â†’ bandwidth (window radius)\n",
    "   - \\(K(\\cdot)\\) â†’ kernel function (e.g., Gaussian, flat, Epanechnikov)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Repeat**\n",
    "   Continue until \\(y_{t+1} - y_t\\) is below a small threshold (no further movement).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each \\(x_i\\) traces a trajectory \\(y_0, y_1, \\ldots, y_\\ast\\) that converges to a **mode**.\n",
    "Points whose paths meet at the same mode are assigned to the same cluster.\n",

    "## Mean Shift Vector\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"shift\" at each iteration is the vector difference:\n",

    "m(y_t) = y_{t+1} - y_t =\n",
    "\\frac{\\sum_j K\\!\\left(\\frac{\\|x_j - y_t\\|^2}{h^2}\\right) (x_j - y_t)}\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It always points toward **higher data density**,\n",
    "so each step moves *uphill* on the estimated density surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is equivalent to performing **gradient ascent**\n",
    "on the kernel density estimate (KDE) of the data.\n",

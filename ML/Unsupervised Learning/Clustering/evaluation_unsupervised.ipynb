    "- Moderate global scores (e.g., \\(0.3\\text{–}0.5\\)) can still reflect *valid* clusterings when clusters naturally sit close together.\n",

    "**Common failure modes:**\n",
    "- **Overlapping or adjacent clusters:** Many \\( s(i) \\approx 0 \\).\n",
    "- **Elongated / non-globular clusters:** \\( a(i) \\) grows within the same cluster → silhouette penalizes.\n",
    "- **Uneven densities:** Dense clusters get larger \\( s \\) than sparse ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to try:**\n",
    "- Consider **alternative indices** (e.g., Calinski–Harabasz, Davies–Bouldin) that trade off compactness/separation differently.\n",

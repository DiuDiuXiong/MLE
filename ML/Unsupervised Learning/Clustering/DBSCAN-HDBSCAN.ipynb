    "\n",
    "- **DBSCAN**: finds clusters as **dense regions** separated by low-density gaps; labels outliers as **noise**.\n",
    "- **HDBSCAN**: generalises DBSCAN by exploring **all density levels** (all \\( \\varepsilon \\)) and selecting **stable clusters**.\n",
    "- **K-Means**: partitions space around **centroids**, assumes roughly **equal variance** and **convex** clusters; no noise label.\n",

    "- **Border**: not core, but within \\( \\varepsilon \\) of a core.\n",
    "- **Noise**: neither core nor border.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Algorithm (intuitive flow)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pick an **unvisited** point.\n",
    "2. If **core**, start a cluster and **expand** by recursively adding neighbors within \\( \\varepsilon \\) (core chains).\n",

    "2. Build an **MST** on these weights.\n",
    "3. Sweep density via \\( \\lambda = 1/\\varepsilon \\):\n",
    "   - as \\( \\lambda \\) increases (i.e., \\( \\varepsilon \\) decreases), **cut** MST edges with weight \\(> \\varepsilon\\);\n",
    "   - clusters **split** at those cuts → a **hierarchy**.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 4) Your reasoning (DBSCAN ↔ HDBSCAN via MST)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ignore the “\\( k \\)-neighbor” rule: build an MST on **pairwise distances**; **cut** edges \\(>\\varepsilon\\) → connected components match “DBSCAN-without-core-rule.”\n",
    "2. DBSCAN’s extra constraint (must have \\( k \\) neighbors) is folded into HDBSCAN by redefining distances:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   d_{\\mathrm{mreach}}(a,b)=\\max(\\operatorname{core\\_dist}(a),\\operatorname{core\\_dist}(b),\\|a-b\\|)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   which **inflates** edges in sparse zones so tiny/isolated groups don’t become clusters.\n",
    "3. Cutting the **HDBSCAN MST** at a single \\( \\varepsilon \\) **recovers DBSCAN(\\( \\varepsilon,k \\))** on **core points**; attach border points within \\( \\varepsilon \\) to match DBSCAN labels.\n",

    "  - Too small → many **noise** points; clusters fragment.\n",
    "  - Too large → clusters **merge**; structure blurs.\n",
    "- **\\( k=\\text{min\\_samples} \\)**:\n",
    "  - Higher → more **conservative** (more noise, denser clusters).\n",
    "  - Lower → more **sensitive** (may pick spurious small clusters).\n",
    "- **Metric**: Euclidean; **cosine** for text; **L1** for sparse data.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 5.2 HDBSCAN\n",
    "- **min\\_cluster\\_size**: minimum population to count as a **stable** cluster. ↑ → fewer/larger clusters, more noise.\n",
    "- **min\\_samples \\( (=k) \\)**: conservativeness of density estimate; default \\(=\\) min\\_cluster\\_size is often good.\n",
    "- **Metric**: same as DBSCAN. For embeddings, cosine + UMAP works best.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip (embeddings):**\n",

    "- **DBSCAN/HDBSCAN** rely on **local density**:\n",
    "  - Retain **tight** and **loose** blobs simultaneously.\n",
    "  - Mark **outliers** as **noise**.\n",
    "  - **HDBSCAN** examines **all \\( \\varepsilon \\)** and selects **stable** clusters.\n",

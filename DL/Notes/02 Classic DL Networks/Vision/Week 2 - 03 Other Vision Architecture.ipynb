    "# Project: Aether-Vision\n",
    "# A Distributed High-Resolution Image & Video Analysis System\n",
    "## 1. The Mission\n",
    "The goal of Aether-Vision is to transform raw visual data (images and videos) into human-readable scene descriptions. While pre-trained models like YOLOv12 or LLaVA exist to solve this today, this project is a \"Learning by Reconstruction\" effort. We are intentionally building the entire stack—from the fundamental training physics to the distributed inference infrastructure—to master the complexities of modern Machine Learning Engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Final Product Vision\n",
    "Input: A high-resolution image or video file uploaded via a cloud-hosted gateway.\n",
    "\n",
    "Processing: The image is securely streamed to a remote \"GPU Engine,\" where it is tiled and analyzed by a custom-trained deep learning backbone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: A structured natural language description identifying multiple objects and their general context (e.g., \"Detected a mountain bike in the foreground and a forest trail in the background; likely an outdoor sporting scene.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Phase 1: The \"Backbone\" (Research & Training)\n",
    "We will train a state-of-the-art vision architecture (e.g., ConvNeXt or ResNet-50) from scratch using the 115GB ImageNet-1k dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Learning Goal: To understand convergence, optimization (AdamW/SGD), and the data-loading bottlenecks that occur when moving beyond \"toy\" datasets into 100GB+ scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hardware Challenge: Fully saturating an RTX 4090 by implementing high-performance data pipelines (using FFCV or WebDataset) to ensure the GPU is never \"starving\" for data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Phase 2: The \"Orchestrator\" (Infrastructure & Production)\n",
    "Moving beyond the notebook, we productionize the model using a Hybrid Cloud Architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed Inference: A lightweight Control Plane (AWS/GCP/DigitalOcean) handles user requests and proxies them to a remote Inference Worker (the 4090) via gRPC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tiling Engine: To handle high-resolution inputs where standard models might miss small details, the system will programmatically \"tile\" images into segments, process them in parallel, and aggregate the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "SRE Principles: Implementing health checks, circuit breakers, and observability (metrics/logs) to ensure the system remains reliable even if the remote GPU connection is unstable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Why Build This From Scratch?\n",
    "To own the weights: Understanding the \"Training Recipe\" allows us to modify the model for specific needs (like Canva’s internal datasets) in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the \"Resolution Problem\": Off-the-shelf models often downsample images to 640px, losing critical detail. Our Tiling approach preserves every pixel for maximum accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To Master the Bridge: Connecting separate infrastructure providers into one low-latency service is a core MLE/SRE skill that cannot be learned using a single-click deployment tool."
